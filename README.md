Employee absenteeism is a critical issue that affects productivity and operational efficiency in organizations. As businesses strive to optimize workforce management, data-driven insights play a crucial role in understanding absenteeism patterns and addressing the underlying causes. In this blog, I’ll walk you through my project on HR Absenteeism Analysis, where I leveraged SQL and Power BI to uncover key insights and trends.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze absenteeism data and identify patterns that impact business performance. By using SQL for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for visualization, I was able to develop an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for HR teams.

Dataset Used
The dataset contains records of employee absenteeism, including details such as:

Employee ID
Date of absence
Reason for absence
Department
Working hours lost
Age, BMI, and other demographics
Transportation issues, alcohol consumption, and other external factors
Data Preparation and Cleaning with SQL
Before diving into visualization, I first cleaned and structured the data using SQL. The key steps involved were:

Handling Missing Values: Replacing or removing null values in key columns.
Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistency in date formats and categorical variables.
Creating Calculated Fields: Generating new columns such as total hours lost per employee and absenteeism rates per department.
Filtering Outliers: Identifying and excluding extreme cases to maintain data integrity.

Once the data was cleaned, I imported it into Power BI and built an interactive dashboard to visualise absenteeism trends. Here are some of the key insights:

1. Absenteeism Trends Over Time
There are peak absenteeism periods, especially at the start of the week and around holiday seasons.
Certain months show higher absenteeism rates, possibly due to seasonal factors.
2. Department-Wise Absenteeism Analysis
Some departments exhibit higher absenteeism rates than others.
Trends suggest that absenteeism may be linked to job roles, work pressure, or environmental conditions.
3. Impact of External Factors
Employees with high BMI tend to have a higher frequency of absences.
Transportation issues and alcohol consumption are correlated with increased absenteeism rates.
4. Employee Demographics and Absenteeism
Younger employees (20–30 years) and older employees (50+ years) have different absenteeism patterns.
Employees in specific age groups or health conditions exhibit unique absenteeism behaviours.

Business Implications and Recommendations
Based on the findings, here are some recommendations for HR teams and management:

Flexible Work Policies: Introducing remote work options or hybrid models for employees with high absenteeism rates.
Health and Wellness Programs: Encouraging fitness and wellness programs to address health-related absenteeism.
Transportation Support: Providing company-sponsored transport solutions to reduce lateness and absenteeism.
Department-Specific Strategies: Implementing targeted interventions for departments with high absenteeism.
Conclusion
This project highlights the power of SQL and Power BI in driving data-driven decision-making for HR management. By analysing absenteeism trends, organisations can proactively address workforce challenges, optimise productivity, and improve employee well-being.
